\chapter{Decay widths}

As was mentioned in~\cref{sec:intro:sumrules}, sumrule gives exact zero when initial state is under threshold. For this reason we focus at specific pseudo-scalar ($\chi_{c0}(1P)$, $\chi_{b0}(1P)$) and tensor ($\chi_{c2}(1P)$, $\chi_{b2}(1P)$) states which respect the latter condition, for them we are going to conduct further analysis.

First of all, as a cross-check we provide unpolarized decay widths and compare them to results obtained by Deng et al.~\cite{deng-charm,deng-bot} and presented in PDG~\cite{pdg}.
