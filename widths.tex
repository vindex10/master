\chapter{Decay widths}

As was mentioned in~\cref{sec:intro:sumrules}, sumrule gives exact zero when initial state is under threshold. For this reason we focus at $\psi(1S),\psi(2S),\psi(3S)$ for charmonium and for testing artifacts of ``relativisticity'' $\Upsilon(1S),\Upsilon(2S),\Upsilon(3S)$ states of bottomonium which respect the latter condition.

We provide unpolarized decay widths and $r^{(0,2)}$ coefficients in three different approximations. $\Gamma$ represents decay width which includes electric and magnetic multipole terms up to $J=8$. Then we provide only $E1$ contribution because it is a good cross-check of the rule we mentioned above, that $r$'s doesn't depend on radial wave function. Finally, we provide $ELW$ column which represents ``long wave approximation'' ($E1$ in the limit of $\vec{k} \rightarrow \infty$). The latter approximation is important because calculations can be conducted by hand. Each table shows our results in comparison to Deng et al.~\cite{deng-charm,deng-bot} and to those presented in PDG~\cite{pdg}.
